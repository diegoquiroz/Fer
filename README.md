# Data Structures Final Project

This is my final project of Data Structures course in AnÃ¡huac University. In this course i've learned how to evaluate different datastructures to know which one is the right one to use in a project.

## Getting Started

The intention for this "library" is to provide tools to facilitate the processing of data. By now the functionality is very limited, alloing only to:

- Tokenize texts and files.
- Correct mispelled words using a tokenized dataset.

### Prerequisites

There are not prerrequisites for using this software.


### Installing

Since this is not a pip package, is important to know that the only way to implement this code is by cloning it to your projects folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/diegoquiroz/Fer.git
```

Now you only need to import the desired clases or methods.

```
from Fer.Fer import Corrector, tokenize_file
```

Start processing your textsðŸ˜‰

## Used data structures

- Binary Tree.
- Array.
